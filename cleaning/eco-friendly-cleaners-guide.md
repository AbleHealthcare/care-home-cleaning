# Sustainable Cleaning Solutions for Care Homes: What You Need to Know

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword — in care homes, it’s becoming a core part of infection control and operational efficiency. Moving towards eco-friendly cleaning solutions can benefit both your residents and the planet.

Many care homes face the challenge of balancing hygiene standards with reducing environmental impact. Fortunately, modern green cleaning products have advanced significantly, offering effective performance without harmful chemicals or excessive waste.

## What Makes a Cleaner “Eco-Friendly”?

Eco-friendly cleaners are designed to minimise environmental harm while maintaining rigorous cleaning standards. They typically feature:

- Biodegradable ingredients that break down naturally  
- Minimal or recyclable packaging, often in concentrated or sachet form  
- Reduced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and harsh chemicals  
- Safe use around vulnerable populations like elderly residents

These products help care homes reduce their carbon footprint and chemical load without compromising cleanliness.

## Why Sachet-Based Systems Are Gaining Popularity

One of the most practical innovations in eco-cleaning is the use of pre-measured sachets. These dissolve completely in water, eliminating the need for heavy plastic containers and reducing dosing errors.

Benefits include:

- Simplified storage and transport  
- Consistent dosing for every use  
- Lower risk of spills or exposure to concentrated chemicals  
- Waste reduction thanks to minimal packaging

Sachet systems align well with care homes’ need for safe, effective, and easy-to-use products.

## Making the Transition in Your Care Home

Switching to eco-friendly cleaning doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Many care homes start small — replacing one or two key products — then expand as staff get comfortable with new routines.

Training and clear instructions help ensure correct usage and maintain compliance with infection control protocols.
